"""run_code reads the user's uploads whole: load_upload / list_uploads.

An uploaded shapefile used to reach the model only as GeoJSON pasted into
the prompt, so code could use it only by retyping it. A 23-feature,
13,059-vertex neighborhoods layer came back as a 369-vertex copy with a
mistyped coordinate, after a first attempt that returned nothing at all.
The web server now stages each converted upload in the session's sandbox
folder (<output dir>/uploads/), and these helpers read it there.
